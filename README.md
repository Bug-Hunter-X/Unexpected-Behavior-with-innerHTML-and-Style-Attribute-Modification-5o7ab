# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML and Style Attribute Conflict

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the interaction between `innerHTML` and dynamically modifying the `style` attribute of an HTML element. The bug occurs when using `innerHTML` to replace the content of an element that initially has a style attribute set.  The updated content using `innerHTML` does not correctly reflect the previous style, leading to unexpected display behavior.

## Problem Description

The main issue is that directly manipulating a style attribute with `innerHTML` doesn't always cleanly overwrite or update existing styles. The original style may unexpectedly persist or conflict with the new styles defined within the `innerHTML`.
